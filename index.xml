      <description>SELinux is a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system, developed by the NSA. SELinux was developed as a replacement for Discretionary Access Control (DAC) that ships with most Linux distributions.
The difference between Discretionary Access Controls and Mandatory Access Controls is the means by which users and applications gain access to machines. Traditionally, the command sudo gives a user the ability to heighten permissions to root-level. Root access on a DAC system gives the person or program with root access permission to perform as desired on a machine.</description>
